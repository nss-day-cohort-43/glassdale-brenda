Presentations
Introduce your team and members
Introduce the project and the persona
Use your persona as a tool to present your project and tell a story showcasing the features of the app.
Each person on the team should speak about their contributions.
Keep your vocabulary positive.
Treat your presentation as the "first time we have ever seen this app".
You may use words like "coming in V2".
If a bug happens, continue talking. Don't dwell on it.
Be sure to remove all 'debugger' and consoles before presentation.
Close the dev tools during presentation.

Closing thoughts:
Consider what you learned most.
Consider what you might do differently.
Consider what worked out the best.
If you had more time, what would you do next?
